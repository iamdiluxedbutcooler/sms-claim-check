Extract MINIMAL claim phrases - just enough to convey the assertion\n2. Claims should be ATOMIC - one verifiable fact per claim\n3. Claims should overlap with actual message text (extract spans, don't paraphrase)\n4. Include enough context to be verifiable (e.g., \"Amazon package delayed\" not just \"package delayed\")\n5. DO NOT include URLs, phone numbers, or amounts in claim text (those are entities)\n6.
